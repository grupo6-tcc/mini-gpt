## About 
This repository contains a natural language processing experiment focused on the domain of diseases and question‑answering, centered on a simplified GPT‑type model (“mini‑GPT”). The goal is to explore text generation or manipulation related to medical conditions (descriptions, symptoms, questions/answers) using both short and long datasets, along with metrics and result reports.

Project Contents:

• Data files, e.g., dados-doencas-textos-curtos.txt, dados-doencas-textos-longos.txt, dados-perguntas-respostas.txt.

• A notebook (notebook.ipynb) for conducting the experimental/development workflow of the model.

• A results report (mini-gpt-results.pdf) detailing the experiment findings.

• A requirements.txt file listing the environment dependencies.

• A .gitignore configured to avoid versioning unnecessary files.
